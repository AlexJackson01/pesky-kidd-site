        Pesky Kidd is a rock band from London that formed in early
        2022. Summer last year, they started playing in pubs and clubs around
        London and by Christmas had amassed a small but loyal following. 2023
        saw them move up to playing some of the better music venues for amateur
        bands in London (like the O2 Academy Islington twice, and booking
        upcoming shows at Camden Assembly, Bobstock and Fiddler's Elbow amongst
        other dates in March and April). Influenced by bands ranging from System
        of a Down to Nirvana, Green Day to Radiohead, the band's sound is melody
        driven, often fusing a traditional writing style and hooky pop-punk and
        alt rock elements with contemporary production values. The latest
        track "With You" is the first single from the upcoming 2nd album, which
        is expected to be released early Summer 2023 and is a great example of
        what's to come.
