        Pesky Kidd is a rock duo from London that formed in early 2022. Summer
        last year, they started playing in pubs and clubs around London and by
        Christmas had amassed a small but loyal following. 2023 saw them move up
        to playing some of the better music venues for amateur bands in London
        (like the O2 Academy, Islington, Camden Assembly and The Fiddler's
        Elbow) and supporting Pulled Apart By Horses. The latest release "With
        You" has already been played on the Voice FM "Punk on the Rocks" show,
        Black Cat Radio's "New Music and Alternative Classics" with James Page,
        Surrey Hills Radio's "Transmission", The Island Radio's "Alternative"
        show, and Black Country Radio.

        Pesky Kidd always supports people in need and in March 2023, they took
        part in “Rising”, a Charity online show for WarChild UK.

        Pesky Kidd is influenced by bands ranging from System of a Down to
        Nirvana, Green Day to Radiohead. The band's sound is melody driven,
        often fusing a traditional writing style, and hooky pop-punk and alt
        rock elements with contemporary production values. Each track is related
        to a turbulent or joyful experience and tries to express the emotional
        reactions to those situations as authentically as possible.
