        Pesky Kidd is a rock duo from London that formed in early 2022. Summer
        last year, they started playing in pubs and clubs around London and by
        Christmas had amassed a small but loyal following. 2023 saw them move up
        to playing some of the better music venues for amateur bands in London
        (like the O2 Academy Islington twice) and supporting Pulled Apart By
        Horses. Pesky Kidd is influenced by bands ranging from System of a Down
        to Nirvana, Green Day to Radiohead. The band's sound is melody driven,
        often fusing a traditional writing style, and hooky pop-punk and alt rock
        elements with contemporary production values.
