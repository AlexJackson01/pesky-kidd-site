        <p className='band-blurb'>Pesky Kidd is a rock band formed in 2022, made up of Ben Forsythe on vocals and rhythm guitar, Luca Chessa on lead guitar, keyboardist Lee Godkin, XXXXXX on bass and 'Shinners' on drums.  Their music belongs to the indie rock/punkrock genre and with versatile ability, they deliver a multitude of stories through their tracks - some with melancholic melodies, whilst others are electrifying - but each song is consistently an anthem to lose yourself in. Their latest single "Civilian Rebellion" is an infectious, upbeat and hook-filled tune wringing with anti-establishment and revolution!</p>
